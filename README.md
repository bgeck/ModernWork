# ModernWork

ModernWork is a live remote coding session where art is created in realtime with audience input. I performed this piece live at the (Sub)Urban Projections 2016 festival.

I was aided by my partner for this project, Adam Wendt. He was at the festival in Oregon and worked hard on logistics, and maintaining the piece throughout the festival, while I programmed live from my house in Santa Fe and streamed it to the audience there in Oregon.
